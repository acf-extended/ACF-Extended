== WPML & Polylang Multilangual  ==

Advanced Custom Fields comes with a WPML compatibility module for Fields, Field Groups & Options Page ID. However, it will only take care of Options Pages with the default `options` post id. When WPML is enabled, ACF will translate the post id to `options_{lang}`. ie: `options_en`.

ACF Extended adds a new layer of compatibility for both WPML & Polylang. Options Pages post ids and all ACF Extended Modules (Dynamic Post Type, Taxonomy, Options Pages, Block Type) are now compatible.

= WPML =
Options Pages with custom post id are automatically translated. ie: `my-theme` will become `my-theme_en` when switching language. If an Options Page was manually registered with a custom post id including a language code at the end, then the post id won't be translated.

Dynamic Post Type, Taxonomy, Options Pages & Block Type items are automatically registered as WPML string, and can be translated using the WPML String Translation module.

= Polylang =
Options Pages with custom post id are automatically translated. ie: `my-theme` will become `my-theme_en_US` when switching language. If an Options Page was manually registered with a custom post id including a language code at the end, then the post id won't be translated. The module is also compatible with the [ACF Options for Polylang](https://wordpress.org/plugins/acf-options-for-polylang/) plugin.

Dynamic Post Type, Taxonomy, Options Pages & Block Type items are automatically registered as Polylang strings, and can be translated using the Polylang String Translation module.

== ACF: Single Meta Save (Beta) ==

Compress all fields values from the current post, term, user or options into one single meta data. This process lighten the database load as values are saved and read from one single row. Once activated and after saving a post/term/user in the administration, all old meta data will be removed and packed together in a meta called `acf`.

To monitor the process, it is possible to enable the "ACF Extended: Dev Mode" which will display all WP & ACF meta data on every Posts, Terms, Users & Options.

This feature also enables a new setting available in every fields: "Save as individual meta". If this setting is turned ON on a specific field, then the value will be saved individually. `WP Queries` and `Meta Queries` can be used just like before.

Single Meta Save is disabled by default. To enable it, add the following code in your `functions.php` file:

`
add_action('acf/init', 'my_acfe_modules');
function my_acfe_modules(){
    
    // Enable Single Meta Save
    acfe_update_setting('modules/single_meta', true);
    
}

// Enable Single Meta Save on specific Post Types only (default: all)
add_filter('acfe/modules/single_meta/post_types', 'my_acfe_single_meta_post_types');
function my_acfe_single_meta_post_types($post_types){

    $post_types = array('page', 'my-post-type');

    // Disable all post types:
    // return false;

    return $post_types;

}

// Enable Single Meta Save on specific Taxonomies only (default: all)
add_filter('acfe/modules/single_meta/taxonomies', 'my_acfe_single_meta_taxonomies');
function my_acfe_single_meta_taxonomies($taxonomies){

    $taxonomies = array('category', 'my-taxonomy');

    // Disable all taxonomies:
    // return false;

    return $taxonomies;

}

// Enable Single Meta Save on specific Options ID (default: disabled)
add_filter('acfe/modules/single_meta/options', 'my_acfe_single_meta_options');
function my_acfe_single_meta_options($options_ids){

    $options_ids = array('options', 'my-option-id');

    // Disable all options id (default):
    // return false;

    return $options_ids;

}
`

Note: It is possible to revert back to the native ACF save process. To do so, keep the feature enabled, get in the post administration you want to revert back. Disable the feature in your code, and save the post. All data will be saved back to individual meta data.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to enable PHP Auto Sync? =

Create a folder `/acfe-php/` in your theme. Go to your field group administration, check to 'Sync PHP' option in the sidebar and save the field group.

= How to disable PHP/Json Auto Sync? =

Once you activated PHP or Json Sync on a field group, you must manually delete the file `group_xxxxxxxxxx` in your theme folder in order disable it. This behavior is applied to avoid any data desynchronization.

= How to get fields set in the Post Type List location? =

Fields are saved in the option: `{post_type}_options`. Frontend usage example: `get_field('my_field', 'page_options')`

= How to get fields set in the Taxonomy List location? =

Fields are saved in the option: `tax_{taxonomy}_options`. Frontend usage example: `get_field('my_field', 'tax_category_options')`

= How to activate the Post Type Archive location? =

The post type archive location is a virtual option page created under the post type menu of your choice. In order to activate this feature, you must set `acfe_admin_archive => true` in the `register_post_type()` declaration. Once activated, a new submenu called "Archive" will appear under the said post type. Then, you'll be able to set this location in any field group.

Note: This feature is available in the Dynamic Post Type UI in the Administration > Tools > Post Types, under the "Admin" tab.

= How to get fields set in the Post Type Archive location? =

Fields are saved in the option: `{post_type}_archive`. Frontend usage example: `get_field('my_field', 'post_archive')`.

You can also using the following code in any Post Type Archive/Single Template:

`
if(have_archive()):
    while(have_archive()): the_archive();

        // Retrieve 'my_field' from the current Post Type Archive Page
        echo get_field('my_field');

    endwhile;
endif;
`

Or you can also pass a post type, in order to retrieve fields from specific Post Type Archive Page:

`
if(have_archive('my-post-type')):
    while(have_archive('my-post-type')): the_archive();

        // Retrieve 'my_field' from "My Post Type" - Archive Page
        echo get_field('my_field');

    endwhile;
endif;
`

= How the bidirectional field setting works? =

Usage example:

* Create a field group "Page: Relation" displaying on the post type: page

* Inside it, create a relationship field, allowing the post type: post

* Create an another field group "Post: Relation" displaying on the post type: post

* Inside it, create a relationship field, allowing the post type: page

* Activate the "Bidirectional" setting and select the "Page: Relation" relationship field

* Edit any page, and select any post of the post type post in the relationship field

* The page is now also saved in the said post relationship field

= How to migrate existing data with the bidirectional field setting? =

The bidirectional setting has been designed to be optimized in terms of performance. Which means that it checks if the old value is different from the new one, to avoid saving and re-saving the same existing value on each update.

If there is already existing data before the activation of the setting, you'll have to perform a maintenance on the concerned posts.

First, enable the filter to force update on both side. This will bypass the existing value check.

`
add_filter('acfe/bidirectional/force_update/name=my_field', '__return_true');
`

You can then head over the admin, and save each one of the posts. Additionally, you can create a script in order to populate all the values automatically. Here is a code example:

`
add_action('admin_init', 'my_update_all_post_meta');
function my_update_all_post_meta(){

    // Retrieve all pages
    $get_posts = get_posts(array(
        'post_type'         => 'page', // Post Type: page
        'posts_per_page'    => -1,
        'fields'            => 'ids',
    ));

    // Bail early if no post was found
    if(empty($get_posts))
        return;

    // Force bidirectional update
    add_filter('acfe/bidirectional/force_update/name=my_field', '__return_true');

    foreach($get_posts as $post_id){

        // Retrieve Data
        $my_field = get_field('my_field', $post_id, false);

        // Update Data
        update_field('my_field', $my_field, $post_id);

    }

    add_filter('acfe/bidirectional/force_update/name=my_field', '__return_false');

}
`

= How to use Flexible Content: Templates, Styles & Scripts render? =

Templates, styles & scripts settings are saved in each layouts. They can be accessed manually via `get_field('my_flexible')` for example.

The settings are saved in the following keys: `acfe_flexible_render_template`, `acfe_flexible_render_style` and `acfe_flexible_render_script`.

ACF Extended has two functions which will automatically include those files: `echo get_flexible($selector, $post_id)` or `the_flexible($selector, $post_id)` (`$post_id` is optional).

Usage example: `the_flexible('my_flexible');`.

When using this function, you have access to the following global variables: `$layout`, `$field` & `$is_preview` (when Dynamic Preview setting is enabled).
