== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to enable PHP Auto Sync? =

Create a folder `/acfe-php/` in your theme. Go to your field group administration, check to 'Sync PHP' option in the sidebar and save the field group.

= How to disable PHP/Json Auto Sync? =

Once you activated PHP or Json Sync on a field group, you must manually delete the file `group_xxxxxxxxxx` in your theme folder in order disable it. This behavior is applied to avoid any data desynchronization.

= How to get fields set in the Post Type List location? =

Fields are saved in the option: `{post_type}_options`. Frontend usage example: `get_field('my_field', 'page_options')`

= How to get fields set in the Taxonomy List location? =

Fields are saved in the option: `tax_{taxonomy}_options`. Frontend usage example: `get_field('my_field', 'tax_category_options')`

= How to activate the Post Type Archive location? =

The post type archive location is a virtual option page created under the post type menu of your choice. In order to activate this feature, you must set `acfe_admin_archive => true` in the `register_post_type()` declaration. Once activated, a new submenu called "Archive" will appear under the said post type. Then, you'll be able to set this location in any field group.

Note: This feature is available in the Dynamic Post Type UI in the Administration > Tools > Post Types, under the "Admin" tab.

= How to get fields set in the Post Type Archive location? =

Fields are saved in the option: `{post_type}_archive`. Frontend usage example: `get_field('my_field', 'post_archive')`.

You can also using the following code in any Post Type Archive/Single Template:

`
if(have_archive()):
    while(have_archive()): the_archive();

        // Retrieve 'my_field' from the current Post Type Archive Page
        echo get_field('my_field');

    endwhile;
endif;
`

Or you can also pass a post type, in order to retrieve fields from specific Post Type Archive Page:

`
if(have_archive('my-post-type')):
    while(have_archive('my-post-type')): the_archive();

        // Retrieve 'my_field' from "My Post Type" - Archive Page
        echo get_field('my_field');

    endwhile;
endif;
`

= How the bidirectional field setting works? =

Usage example:

* Create a field group "Page: Relation" displaying on the post type: page

* Inside it, create a relationship field, allowing the post type: post

* Create an another field group "Post: Relation" displaying on the post type: post

* Inside it, create a relationship field, allowing the post type: page

* Activate the "Bidirectional" setting and select the "Page: Relation" relationship field

* Edit any page, and select any post of the post type post in the relationship field

* The page is now also saved in the said post relationship field

= How to migrate existing data with the bidirectional field setting? =

The bidirectional setting has been designed to be optimized in terms of performance. Which means that it checks if the old value is different from the new one, to avoid saving and re-saving the same existing value on each update.

If there is already existing data before the activation of the setting, you'll have to perform a maintenance on the concerned posts.

First, enable the filter to force update on both side. This will bypass the existing value check.

`
add_filter('acfe/bidirectional/force_update/name=my_field', '__return_true');
`

You can then head over the admin, and save each one of the posts. Additionally, you can create a script in order to populate all the values automatically. Here is a code example:

`
add_action('admin_init', 'my_update_all_post_meta');
function my_update_all_post_meta(){

    // Retrieve all pages
    $get_posts = get_posts(array(
        'post_type'         => 'page', // Post Type: page
        'posts_per_page'    => -1,
        'fields'            => 'ids',
    ));

    // Bail early if no post was found
    if(empty($get_posts))
        return;

    // Force bidirectional update
    add_filter('acfe/bidirectional/force_update/name=my_field', '__return_true');

    foreach($get_posts as $post_id){

        // Retrieve Data
        $my_field = get_field('my_field', $post_id, false);

        // Update Data
        update_field('my_field', $my_field, $post_id);

    }

    add_filter('acfe/bidirectional/force_update/name=my_field', '__return_false');

}
`

= How to use Flexible Content: Templates, Styles & Scripts render? =

Templates, styles & scripts settings are saved in each layouts. They can be accessed manually via `get_field('my_flexible')` for example.

The settings are saved in the following keys: `acfe_flexible_render_template`, `acfe_flexible_render_style` and `acfe_flexible_render_script`.

ACF Extended has two functions which will automatically include those files: `echo get_flexible($selector, $post_id)` or `the_flexible($selector, $post_id)` (`$post_id` is optional).

Usage example: `the_flexible('my_flexible');`.

When using this function, you have access to the following global variables: `$layout`, `$field` & `$is_preview` (when Dynamic Preview setting is enabled).

= How to change PHP AutoSync Load/Save paths? =

PHP AutoSync settings are very similar to the native ACF Json settings. To alter load/save paths, you can use the following method:

`
// PHP Autosync: Save path
add_filter('acfe/settings/php_save', 'my_acfe_php_save_point');
function my_acfe_php_save_point($path){

    // update path
    $path = get_stylesheet_directory() . '/my-custom-folder';

    // return
    return $path;

}

// PHP Autosync: Load paths
add_filter('acfe/settings/php_load', 'my_acfe_php_load_point');
function my_acfe_php_load_point($paths){

    // remove original path (optional)
    unset($paths[0]);

    // append path
    $paths[] = get_stylesheet_directory() . '/my-custom-folder';

    // return
    return $paths;

}
`

= How to disable specific ACF Extended modules? (Dynamic Post Types, Taxonomies, Options Pages etc...) =

You can use the following action:

`
add_action('acf/init', 'my_acfe_modules');
function my_acfe_modules(){
    
    // Disable Ajax Author box
    acfe_update_setting('modules/author', false);
    
    // Disable ACF > Block Types
    acfe_update_setting('modules/dynamic_block_types', false);
    
    // Disable Forms
    acfe_update_setting('modules/dynamic_forms', false);
    
    // Disable Tools > Post Types
    acfe_update_setting('modules/dynamic_post_types', false);
    
    // Disable Tools > Taxonomies
    acfe_update_setting('modules/dynamic_taxonomies', false);
    
    // Disable ACF > Options Pages
    acfe_update_setting('modules/dynamic_options_pages', false);
    
    // Disable Settings > Options
    acfe_update_setting('modules/options', false);
